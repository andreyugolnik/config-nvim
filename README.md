# Nvim from Scratch

This repository contains my custom Neovim configuration for Linux, macOS, and potentially Windows. The setup is built from scratch and includes only the plugins I actively use in my workflow. I primarily use Neovim as a C++ IDE for cross-platform game development.

For the best experience, use it alongside my config-tmux repository.

## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/andreyugolnik/config-nvim.git ~/.config/nvim
```

## Features

- Plugin management via Lazy.nvim.
- Code auto-completion via nvim-cmp.
- Language server protocol (LSP) support via nvim-lspconfig.
- Git integration via neogit or vim-fugitive.
- Code commenting via Comment.nvim.
- Fast buffer navigation via harpoon2.
- Nice statusline via lualine.nvim.
- File tree explorer via nvim-tree.lua.
- Mapping hint via which-key.nvim.
- Code highlighting via nvim-treesitter.
- Colorscheme via tokyonight.
- Markdown writing and previewing via vim-markdown and markdown-preview.nvim.
- And more...
